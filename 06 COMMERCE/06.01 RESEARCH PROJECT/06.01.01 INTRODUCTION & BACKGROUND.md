BACKGROUND
Ankita moved from India to New Zealand at the age of 21, in 2015. Her first job in New Zealand was as a customer service representative at Number One Shoes. She first began her career in cybersecurity while working Customer Service for The Information Management Group, an Auckland-based company that manages the secure destruction of information for government and private organizations, when she became curious about the security of information and what happens when it enters the wrong hands. This led to her exploring the concept of cybersecurity for the first time, and soon she started her first business, Security Lit Limited, which is headquartered in Hamilton but has members in India and Europe.
