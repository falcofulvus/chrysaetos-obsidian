What do you know about the Springbok Tour?
Protest about the Springboks rugby tour. Springboks South African team, apartheid, no people of colour allowed in the team. People didn't want them coming to New Zealand because they're racist. Some people think that there "shouldn't be politics in sports" but they had already made sports political by having racially split teams.
